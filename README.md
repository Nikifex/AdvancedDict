# AdvancedDict
It's just the practice of writing classes for later use.
****To be more precise it is an extended dictionary.***

It was necessary to find the key by value.And I didn't really like that there is no simple method.Well, I wrote it just for ***fun***.
I've used it for numbers, but it's possible for other data types as well.If I come up with something else, I will update the repository.
